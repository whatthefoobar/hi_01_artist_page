# first website
 This was my first website done for a school project. I chose a monochromatic artist portfolio as my theme. I achieved this using HTML, CSS(GRID for image layout) and javascript for the navigation menu.

Mission: Create a webpage using HTML, CSS and optionally JS.

Process:
I drew my design on paper keeping it simple and worked my way through each task focusing on functionality first with minimal styling.
Difficulties:
   - the hardest thing must have been creating a layout, I flipped between Flexbox until I settled for grid especially in the large image gallery. Choosing colors for background in order for text to still be readable and pretty has taken more of my time than I had estimated.
   - besides that settling on a footer that remained on the bottom was a tricky task.
   - an image/text layout was also tricky as the image was shriking faster than the text section in smaller screens.
